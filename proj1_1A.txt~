1. Because the exposure of the camera captured the sky as all-white, the best matches for the pixels on both left and right are the ones with the least calculated displacements.  Then, the features tend to get matched to those on the left because there is no difference in the Euclidean distance. Since all the features are all-white, they match despite the left-right translation.

2. These are mostly caused by smudges on the window, it seems.  In fact, there is a really cool spot to the left-below of the note where you can clearly see the smudge in real2-left and real2-right on the window, which then translates to a "close" value on the depth map!

3.
